# Changelog

## 0.1.2

Still does nothing, but now has a snappy and simple query planner, as well as support for querying by type.
Next up is adding other old dataview filters, primarily tags+etags, inlinks+outlinks, and folder paths. DatacoreJS soon
to follow.

## 0.1.1

This code still essentially does nothing but may as well get into the habbit of releases. Datacore is capable of
indexing markdown files and sections and then storing them in a simple heirarchical database.

Datastore queries are next.

## 0.1.0

Initial pre-release. No functionality in the plugin aside from showing a nice and useless settings tab.
